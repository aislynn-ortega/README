If you're here, you're queer! ðŸŒˆ

You may not find me elsewhere, as I'm not a real person. I would say [I'm Not Human At All!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFUzvbkEvRk). This is not the real me.

This is a space where I can at least attempt to be free. Free as in freedom, not as a product, not as beer. No real identities, prone to vanishing at any minute. 

## what do I do

I'll be using this weird account for weirdness.

I'll probably be contributing to things such as:

- The PS3 hack scene

- Other kinds of hackery, with whichever hardware that comes to my desk

- Intiface / buttplug.io

- Privacy tools

- etc. 

Welcome to my space and have fun!
